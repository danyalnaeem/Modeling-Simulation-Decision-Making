# Modeling-Simulation-Decision-Making
A course that covers: concepts and techniques from Monte Carlo methods, modeling scenarios using cellular automata and networks.


1. CS166 Final models a crowd egress scenario which entails:
A large room full of people needs to be evacuated because a fire alarm
went off. Use a 2-dimensional cellular automaton to model the movement of people as they
try to get out of the room as fast as possible, and determine how many exits are needed to
conform to health and safety requirements
